This solution was mainly created to get familiar with the benchmark framework (e.g., to check that CSV was not working but semi-colon were to be used instead of commas).

It is designed to work on Un&ast;x (only tested on Linux), but may work on Windows with cygwin.

However, since evaluation criteria are independant (a simple addition of points is implied by the evaluation description), we expect this solution to have no point for completeness & correctess, but all points for all other criteria.
If a geometric mean of the points earned in each category was used, then this solution would get 0 points overall.
